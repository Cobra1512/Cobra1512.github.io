                I think that biology courses will be helpful for my future career in biology. I liked a microbiology courses and modern biology labs. <br>
                Aside from the biology courses I took some social stuides courses too. The most remarmakable social science course for me was History of Kazakhstan course. <br>
                Also, I loved public speaking course. The public speaking course was helpful to better understand the structure of speech and realize the importance of physical delivery.<br><br></p>
